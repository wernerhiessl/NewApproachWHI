General rules (always applicable):
- Use IDE/editor capabilities for reading/writing repository files. Do not run terminal/shell/PowerShell commands for file I/O (e.g., Get-Content, Set-Content). Only propose commands when the user explicitly asks, and not for file persistence.
- Persisted outputs must be in English.
- Be deterministic: fixed headings, concise phrasing, and temperature 0. When listing files or sources, sort Aâ€“Z.
- Document minimally during conversation; defer non-essential persistence to avoid interrupting user flow.
- This repo excludes specs/BDD or technical solution design.

Single source of truth:
- Mode-specific behaviors, startup, and switching are defined outside this file; see `meta/how-to-run.md` and the respective mode templates under `templates/modes/`.
