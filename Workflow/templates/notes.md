# Notes – Append-only (SSOT)

Target: `inputs/notes.md`

Format (one block per note):
## <KEY> – <Short title>
<First paragraph: excerpt used in output>

<Optional additional paragraphs>

Rules:
- Keep KEY stable; to revise, append a new block with the same KEY (latest wins).
- No links/paths in text.
